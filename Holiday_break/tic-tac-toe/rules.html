			Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
		</p>
		<p>
			Click on any of the squares to fill in your X or O. Player 1 begins with X while player 2 begins with an O. Once filled, the next player can't fill his symbol in the same place as that of the previous player. The game ends when either player 1 or player 2 wins or it ends in a draw.

			Use the RESET button to restart the game. The player number will continue to change depending on the current player playing so as to help the players know whose turn it is currently.

			That's all to the rules of the game. Now enjoy!!!
