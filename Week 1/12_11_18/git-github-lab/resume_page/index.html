	<h3> Biography</h3>
	<section>
		<p> As a student at the University of Houston, I took courses to develop my skills in the realm of Computer Engineering. I am extremely passionate about programming and am proficient at coding mostly using C++ and Java for projects. I love the experience of having to learn new skills and technologies. I have worked on several projects and online coding challenges (like HackerRank) to improve my programming skills. I have also taken courses in Data Structures and Algorithms to further strengthen my fundamentals and help me become an efficient programmer.</p>
		<p>I am looking for an entry-level software engineering position where I can use my technical skills to work on challenging opportunities in the field of software engineering.</p>

			<!-- Project 1 -->
			<li>
				<h4> <strong> Patatap Clone </strong> 
					<br>
					<strong> July 2018 - Aug 2018 </strong>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Implemented a patatap clone website that plays an animation and sound when a key is pressed. Used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build the website and Paper.js and Howler.js for the animation and sound effects
				</p>
			</li>

			<!-- Project 2 -->
			<li>
				<h4> <strong> Color Guessing Game </strong> 
					<br>
					<strong> Jun 2018 – Jul 2018 </strong>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Built a color game guessing website where the user has to select the correct randomly generated color from a block of 3 or 6 colors depending on the difficulty level of the game. Front-end design implemented using HTML, CSS and JS with jQuery being used for animations and DOM Manipulation.
				</p>
			</li>


			<!-- Project 3 -->
			<li>
				<h4> <strong> Image Gallery </strong> 
					<br>
					<strong> Apr 2018 – Jun 2018 </strong>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Implemented an image gallery website used for posting travel photos. Used HTML and CSS to build the website with Javascript for DOM Manipulation and Bootstrap 3 for page responsiveness. 
				</p>
			</li>


			<!-- Project 4 -->
			<li>
				<h4> <strong> To-Do List </strong> 
					<br>
					<strong> May 2018 – Jun 2018 </strong>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Built a to-do list website to add and remove reminders once completed. Implemented the frontend in HTML, CSS and Javascript; used jQuery and font awesome toolkit for the DOM manipulation and icons respectively. 
				</p>
			</li>


			<!-- Project 5 -->
			<li>
				<h4> <strong> Dominion on an FPGA board </strong> 
					<br>
					<strong> Jan 2018 – May 2018 </strong>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Implemented the classic Dominion game on an FPGA board in Verilog. Programmed the password authentication stage on the FPGA board to authenticate six players to play the game. Involved storing the unique IDs' and passwords' for each player on the ROM. 
				</p>
			</li>


			<!-- Project 6 -->
			<li>
				<h4> <strong> Multi-cycle Unpipelined processor </strong> 
					<br>
					<strong> Jan 2018 – May 2018 </strong>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Simulated a MIPS integer processor capable of loading a specified file recording a sequence of MIPS binaries and outputting the program computation outputs. The processor was capable of handling R-type, branch and ALU instructions fed into it. Programmed the processor in C++. 
				</p>
			</li>


			<!-- Project 7 -->
			<li>
				<h4> <strong> NASA Swarmathon </strong> 
					<br>
					<strong> Aug 2017 – May 2018 </strong>
				</h4>
				<p>
					An autonomous rover programming competition sponsored by NASA and Dr. Aaron Becker. Involved programming a swarm of robots to identify and pick up resources and deliver the resources to a collection zone while detecting and avoiding obstacles. Developed better computer vision algorithms in C++ so that the swarm could complete the task successfully. 
				</p>
			</li>


			<!-- Project 8 -->
			<li>
				<h4> <strong> Start-up Loading Page </strong> 
					<br>
					<strong> Mar 2018 – Apr 2018 </strong>
				</h4>

				</p>
			</li>


			<!-- Project 9 -->
			<li>
				<h4> <strong> Autonomous Mobile Robot </strong> 
					<br>
					<strong> Aug 2017 – Dec 2017 </strong>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Build and programmed a mobile robot to autonomously navigate a maze. Implemented the PID control algorithm in C++ that the robot uses in order to make U and Right turns and avoid obstacles. Wrote the motor I/O driver in C++ enabling the ARM to control the motions of both motors using the built-in PWM capability. 
				</p>
			</li>


			<!-- Project 10 -->
			<li>
				<h4> <strong> LED Cube </strong> 
					<br>
					<strong> Aug 2015 – Dec 2015 </strong>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Constructed an 8*8*8 LED Cube driven by an Arduino via eight-shift registers and eight MOSFETs. Programmed the LEDs to change colors as well as control the speed of the colors. 
				</p>
